Tommy's Portfolio Website V1
This is a portfolio website I made for a client looking to showcase his artwork. It has pages seperated into 3 different styles of art he does, while also having a contact page to send him messages. We decided on creating a new layout so we never got to the shop creation of this one.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

To make this website I began by creating the header that would span across all pages of the website. We decided on a banner that would display the name of the client for this. After that I made the 3 sections that would become the anchor tags to lead the viewer to the artwork pages. After these were made I decided to creat a menu that would turn into a dropdown when the page reached a certain size to avoid the menu options getting too cramped. Once this was done I created the about me page and contact page that was linked to the clients netlify account. To finish the website I created pages for all of the artwork and added the function of enlarging the images when clicked on. A dhortcoming I had with this is I only knew badic frontend at this point and couldn't use a framework that would enlarge the photos for me in a more graceful way.

Optimizations:
If I were to go back to this project, I'd finish out the shop and use a better system for enlarging the selected image.

Lessons Learned:
This was my first project I ever worked on for someone else. I learned a lot about the process of going back and forth with a client to achieve their desired outcome. I alos learned a lot about making drop down menus and using onclick event listeners to enlarge photos. I also had never linked a contact page to an outside source where they could recieve submitted messages, so that was really exciting to finally see work after toying with it for so long.

Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
